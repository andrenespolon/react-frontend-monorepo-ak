# Avatar

An avatar is a visual representation of a user or entity.

## Default

When the image source is unavailable (for example, when there's a problem
displaying the image due to an error), or the source is unspecified, the avatar
component will display a default image.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Default} />

## Image

Use `isDisabled` to disable a checkbox when another action has to be completed
before the checkbox is usable.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Image} />

## Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable an avatar that isn't usable. This sets the avatar
image to 40% opacity using the `opacity.disabled` token.

Avoid using disabled UI. This can cause accessibility problems, because disabled
UI doesn't give enough information to the user about what went wrong and how to
proceed, and will not appear in the tab order.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Disabled} />

## Status

Indicates contextual information by showing a small icon on the avatar. Takes
precedence over presence.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Status} />

## Presence

Indicates a user's online status by showing a small icon on the avatar.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Presence} />

## Sizes

Use `size` to change the size of the Avatar.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Size} />

## Clickable

You can pass `onClick` props as `Function`. Default is a `SyntheticBaseEvent`.
See devtools on console for more information.

<Canvas of={Avatar.Clickable} />
