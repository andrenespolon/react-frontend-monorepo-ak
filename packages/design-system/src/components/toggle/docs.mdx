# Toggle

A toggle is used to view or switch between enabled or disabled states.

## Default

The default form of a toggle. For pages with lots of toggles, use the default
size.

<Canvas of={Toggle.Default} />

## Checked

Set the initial checked value by setting `defaultChecked` (this is optional, by
default it will be set as false if not provided). After that point the checked
value is controlled by the component. Provide an `onChange` handler to be
notified of checked value changes.

<Canvas of={Toggle.Checked} />

## Disabled

A toggle is disabled when a selection has already been made outside of the
current context that negates the need for the toggle.

Avoid using disabled UI. This can cause accessibility problems, because disabled
UI doesn't give enough information to the user about what went wrong and how to
proceed, and will not appear in the tab order.

## Sizes

To call attention to a specific action, use a `large` toggle.

<Canvas of={Toggle.Size} />

## API

<Controls />
