# Button

A button triggers an event or action. They let users know what will happen next.

## Default

The default form of a button, used for most cases. They are not impactful enough
to represent the primary action in a container.

<Canvas of={Button.Default} />

## Appearence

### Primary

Use a `primary` button to call attention to an action on a form or to highlight
the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once
per container (not including the application header or in a modal dialog). Not
every screen requires a primary button.

<Canvas of={Button.Primary} />

### Default

The default button theme.

<Canvas of={Button.Default} />

### Subtle

Use a `subtle` button with a `primary` button for secondary actions, such as
“Cancel".

<Canvas of={Button.Subtle} />

### Link

Use a `link` button to navigate to another page. These should open in the same
window unless information may be lost (for example, when someone is filling out
a form), or when the destination is an external site (for example, a knowledge
base article).

<Canvas of={Button.Link} />

### Subtle link

Similar to a `subtle` button, but behaves like a `link` button. Use a
`subtle-link` button to avoid overwhelming the page with blue links.

<Canvas of={Button.SubtleLink} />

### Warning

A `warning` button appears before we request the user to take action, usually in
anticipation of a significant change. These are found mostly in confirmation
modals.

<Canvas of={Button.Warning} />

### Danger

The `danger` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive action
such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

<Canvas of={Button.Danger} />

## States

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled` to disable a button that isn’t usable. Disabled buttons can
cause accessibility issues as disabled elements are not in the tab order so
wherever possible we recommend avoid using `isDisabled`, especially for form
submissions.

You should never put a tooltip on a disabled button. For more information see
our usage guidelines.

<Canvas of={Button.Disabled} />

### Selected

Set `isSelected` to indicate the button is selected.

<Canvas of={Button.Selected} />

### Loading

Set `isLoading` to indicate the button is loading. The button text is hidden and
a spinner is shown in its place, while maintaining the width that it would have
if the text were visible.

To assist screen readers, it will also set the `aria-busy` attribute based on
the value of `isLoading`. For this reason, it's important that elements
containing LoadingButton's have an `aria-live` attribute (e.g.
`aria-live="polite"`).

<Canvas of={Button.Loading} />

## Icon

Buttons may include an icon before or after the text.

### Before

Display an icon before the text.

<Canvas of={Button.Before} />

### After

Display an icon after the text.

<Canvas of={Button.After} />

## Size

Buttons can have various spacing. Default spacing is used for most use cases,
compact for tables and none for breadcrumbs.

### Default

<Canvas of={Button.Default} />

### Compact

<Canvas of={Button.Compact} />

### None

<Canvas of={Button.None} />

## Full width

Buttons can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Canvas of={Button.FullWidth} />

## Component

Button's `component` prop allows a custom React component or HTML element to
render in place of a `<button>` or `<a>` element.

This is useful for using Button with the `<Link>` component from popular routing
libraries.

**Example**:

<Story of={Button.Component} />

```tsx
function Link(props: any) {
	return (
		<a {...props} href='/#'>
			Link component
		</a>
	);
}

function CustomButton() {
	return <Button component={Link} appearence='default' />;
}
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from '@rfm/design-system';

const Example = () => {
	return (
		<Button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')} appearence='primary'>
			Button
		</Button>
	);
};

export default Example;
```
